# Arrythmia-classification
Early diagnosis of arrhythmia is very significant because the symptoms are not always prominent and may go unnoticed until a deteriorating heart health condition is reached. Due to progress in machine learning techniques and the availability of a larger dataset, it is now possible to analyze and propose better techniques to detect cardiac arrhythmia. This paper presents a new hybrid approach that uses feature selection followed by ensemble classification for the diagnosis of arrhythmia. The feature selection algorithm provides a list of strongly correlated features with arrhythmia and at the same time making sure to use minimum redundant information.
